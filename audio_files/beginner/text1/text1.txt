English translation:
They Are All Very Busy. There are four people in my family: my dad, my mom, my older brother, and me. We also have a little black dog and a big tabby cat. My father is a well-known doctor, and my mother is a middle school English teacher. They are both very busy.
My older brother is a university student majoring in Chinese. He is tall and a bit chubby, so his classmates all call him "Fatty." His girlfriend is very pretty and she is Japanese.
My little dog's name is Hei Hei (Blackie), and the cat's name is Hua Hua (Tabby). Look, this is our house. It's neither too big nor too small. It has four rooms and a very beautiful small garden. My room is not very big, with a small desk, two chairs, and a bed inside.
