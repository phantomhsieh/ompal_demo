今天早上我有一節聽力課，大概昨天夜裡沒睡好，所以起晚了，這下我急壞了，因為開學才半個多月，我已經遲到過兩次了，老師不但記住了我的名字，而且還說下一次我要是再遲到的話，他就不讓我進教室了。
我想去洗洗臉，哎洗澡間的燈怎麼不亮了，算了反正沒時間了，我又穿上昨天脫下的那身衣服，騎上車就往學校趕。教室裡坐著很多學生，可是安靜極了連一點兒聲音也沒有，看來老師還沒到，我趕快找到一個空座位坐好。
這個時候我忽然發現周圍的人都是我的中學同學，每個人的面前還擺著一本數學課本，太奇怪了這節課不是聽力嗎？怎麼又變成我最討厭的高中數學課呢？還有我跟同學們打招呼他們都不答應，只是看著我笑，笑什麼是因為我沒洗臉沒梳頭也沒刮鬍子？還是因為我又穿了兩只顏色不同的襪子？
正當我不知道怎麼辦的時候，叮鈴鈴上課鈴響了，我一下子就醒了，睜開眼睛看了看床頭的鬧鐘六點半，我打開窗戶天還沒亮呢，我呼吸了一口新鮮空氣，心裡得意地想今天肯定不會遲到了。

English translation:
This morning, I had a listening class. Maybe I didn’t sleep well last night because I woke up late. I panicked since it’s been only half a month into the semester, and I’ve already been late twice. The teacher not only remembers my name but also said that if I’m late again, he won’t let me into the classroom.
I wanted to wash my face, but—oh no—the bathroom light wasn’t working. Forget it; I didn’t have time anyway. I put on the same clothes I wore yesterday, hopped on my bike, and rushed to school.
The classroom was filled with students, but it was extremely quiet—so quiet you couldn’t hear a single sound. It seemed like the teacher hadn’t arrived yet. I quickly found an empty seat and sat down.
At that moment, I suddenly realized that everyone around me was my high school classmates, and each of them had a math textbook in front of them. How strange! Wasn’t this supposed to be a listening class? How did it turn into my most hated high school math class?
I greeted my classmates, but they didn’t respond. They just looked at me and smiled. What were they smiling at? Was it because I hadn’t washed my face, combed my hair, or shaved? Or was it because I was wearing mismatched socks again?
Just as I was feeling confused, the class bell rang. Suddenly, I woke up. I opened my eyes and looked at the alarm clock by my bed—it was 6:30. I opened the window, and the sky was still dark. I took a deep breath of fresh air and thought smugly, “I definitely won’t be late today.”
